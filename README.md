Examples of exposing C++ to Clasp

Copy local.config.template into local.config and edit it to configure your system.

To compile the demos use:
<pre>make</pre> 


To run the demos type:
<pre>make test</pre>

Currently these demos are alpha and they require the clasp source code tree.  Soon I will copy from the source code tree everything that is needed and put it in the clasp application directory so that C++ libraries can be exposed without requiring the clasp source code tree.
